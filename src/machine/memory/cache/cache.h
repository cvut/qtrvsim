/**
 * NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY:
 * N-way set associative cache consist of N ways (where N is degree
 * of associativity). Arguments requesting N are called `associativity` of the
 * cache. Each way consist of blocks. (When we want to highlight, that we talk
 * about data + management tags, we speak of cache line. When we speak about
 * location of block within a way, we use the term `row`. Each block consists of
 * some number of basic storage units (here `uint32_t`). To locate a single unit
 * withing block, we use therm `col` (as column).
 *
 * Set is consists of all block on the same row across the ways.
 *
 * We can imagine a cache as 3D array indexed via triple (`way`, `row`, `col`).
 * Row and col are derived from part of a address deterministically. The rest
 * of the address is called `tag`. Set is obtained via linear search and placing
 * into cache, it is determined by cache replacement policy
 * (see `memory/cache/cache_policy.h`).
