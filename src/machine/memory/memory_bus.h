/**
 * Memory bus serves as last level of frontend memory and interconnects it with
 * backend memory devices, that are subscribed to given address range.
 *
 * Simulated core always has exactly one bus. This is necessary to access it
 * (e.g. from syscall) to map new devices. Backend memory device simulation
 * classes are implemented in `memory/backend`. For testing purposes,
 * `TrivialBus` is provided to wrap backend memory device into a minimal
 * frontend interface. Used mapping is always one to one with identity address
 * resolution. TrivialBus does not support external changes.
 * Backend memory devices subscribe to the bus via range descriptions (see
 * `RangeDecs`). Frontend address (`Address` type) is here converted using the
 * range descriptions to relative offset within the given backend memory device.
 * Downstream (frontend -> backend) communication is performed directly and
 * upstream communication is done via "external_change" signals.
