/**
 * # What is frontend memory
 *
 * The core is the entry point to the whole simulated machine. Therefore the
 * reworked concepts can be best understood from its point of view on the memory
 * subsystem. Every core configuration has three mandatory memory components.
 * Two of them  are the entry points for memory operations for program and data,
 * respectively. The entry point starts a chain of memory components of
 * arbitrary length, each backed by the next one. A component that receives a
 * request either resolves it or invokes its lower component. For the core, the
 * chain is invisible, and it only interfaces with the top-level component. The
 * chain is terminated by a memory data bus. Data bus for data memory is the
 * third component I have mentioned.  All of the above components are instances
 * of the frontend memory. Frontend memory has three characteristics. Except for
 * the memory bus, each frontend component must have a frontend component
 * backing it. The memory bus is backed by zero or more backed devices
 * (explained later). All addresses used in the frontend are full memory
 * address. By the word "full", I mean the numerical value observable by a C
 * program (up to address translation), in contrast to a local relative offset.
 * The Address datatype is used to store it and pass as an argument.
 * Finally, frontend memory instances are likely those found on the CPU chip
 * itself (caches, TLB...).
