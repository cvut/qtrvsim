/**
 * Interface for physical memory or periphery.
 * .
 * Device implementing this interface is connected to the memory system via
 * memory data bus (`memory/memory_bus.h`).
 *
 * ## ENDIAN
 * Each device is responsible to return reads and write with the correct endian.
 * This is because there are different optimal ways to perform the swapping in
 * different kind of peripheries. For example, peripheries that have only word
 * (u23) accessible registers are simple to swap.
 *
 * All backend memory devices must set the `simulated_machine_endian` in
 * `BackendMemory` parent. They should also, by convention, have a private
 * (`const` or `static constexpr`) variable `internal_endian`. It can have
 * values `LITTLE | BIG | NATIVE_ENDIAN` (note: `NATIVE_ENDIAN` is a compile
 * time constant with endian of the host machine i.e. `LITTLE | BIG`). Byteswap
 * is needed, when internal and simulated endian are mismatched.
 *
 * ### Examples of internal endian values
 * - LED diode will have `NATIVE_ENDIAN` as the rgb value needs to be valid for
 *   GUI.
 * - Memory mapped source will have runtime set endian, based on the file
 *   endian.
 * - LCD has fixed `BIG` endian, as required by the hardware.
