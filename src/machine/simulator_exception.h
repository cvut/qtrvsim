/* This is list of all QtRvSim specific exceptions
 *
 * Input:
 *  Exception durring input loading
 * Runtime:
 *  Exceptions caused by machine invalid input or unsupported action
 * UnsupportedInstruction:
 *  Decoded instruction is not supported.
 *  This can be cause by really using some unimplemented instruction or because
 * of problems in instruction decode. UnsupportedAluOperation: Decoded ALU
 * operation is not supported This is basically same exception as
 * SimulatorExceptionUnsupportedInstruction but it is emmited from ALU when
 * executed and not before that. Overflow: Integer operation resulted to
 * overflow (or underflow as we are working with unsigned values) This is for
 * sure caused by program it self. UnalignedJump: Instruction is jumping to
 * unaligned address (ADDR % 4 != 0) This can be caused by bug or by user
 * program as it can be jumping relative to register This shouldn't be happening
 * with non-register jumps as those should be verified by compiler
 * UnknownMemoryControl:
 *  Used unknown MemoryAccess control value (write_ctl or read_ctl)
 *  This can be raised by invalid instruction but in such case we shoul raise
 * UnknownInstruction instead So this should signal just some QtRvSim bug.
 * OutOfMemoryAccess:
 *  Trying to access address outside of the memory
 *  As we are simulating whole 32bit memory address space then this is most
 * probably QtRvSim bug if raised not program. Sanity: This is sanity check
 * exception
