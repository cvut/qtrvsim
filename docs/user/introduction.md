# Introduction

Welcome to the **QtRvSim User Manual**.

QtRvSim is a graphical simulator designed to support learning the fundamentals of computer architecture using the **RISC-V instruction set**. It provides an interactive environment for writing, assembling, and simulating simple RISC-V assembly programs. By visualizing instruction execution on different processor models, QtRvSim helps make abstract computer architecture concepts clear and tangible.

The project is developed by the [Computer Architectures Education](http://comparch.edu.cvut.cz) project at [Czech Technical University](http://www.cvut.cz/) and souce code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/cvut/qtrvsim).

## Key Features

- **Visual Datapaths** – Observe execution on both single-cycle and 5-stage pipelined processor models.
- **Integrated Tools** – Write code with the built-in text editor and assemble directly within the simulator.
- **State Inspection** – Inspect register contents, memory, and cache status in real time.
- **Peripheral Emulation** – Experiment with simulated devices, including a terminal, LCD, and LEDs/buttons.
- **Cross-Platform Support** – Available on Linux, Windows, macOS, and via WebAssembly (browser-based).

## About This Manual

This manual will guide you through:
- Installing QtRvSim on your preferred platform
- Understanding the user interface
